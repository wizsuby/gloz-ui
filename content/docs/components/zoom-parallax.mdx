## Usage

To use the zoom-parallax component, import it into your project. If you've created your component in a specific directory, such as `@/registry/animations/source/zoom-paralax-animation`, ensure to reference its location accordingly during import.

```tsx
import ZoomParalaxAnimation from "@/registry/animations/source/zoom-paralax-animation";
```
To statically import the images, ensure they are included in your project's file structure. Then, create an array containing the images to be used within your application.
```tsx
// static import the images
import Picture1 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture1.jpg";
import Picture2 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture2.avif";
import Picture8 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture8.avif";
import Picture4 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture4.avif";
import Picture5 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture5.avif";
import Picture6 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture6.avif";
import Picture7 from "@/public/zoomParalax/picture7.avif";

// create a array of images
const pictures = [
  Picture1,
  Picture2,
  Picture8,
  Picture4,
  Picture5,
  Picture6,
  Picture7,
];
```
The provided code snippet is an example of how to integrate the ZoomParallaxAnimation component into a React application.

1. Enclose the component within a `<section>` tag for structural organization.
2. Inside a `<div>` element with class `my-64` (which presumably applies styling), include the ZoomParallaxAnimation component.
3. Pass the array of pictures (presumably containing image data) to the `pictures` prop of the ZoomParallaxAnimation component.

This setup allows for the incorporation of the ZoomParallaxAnimation component, showcasing a series of pictures with parallax zoom effects within the designated section of the application.
```tsx
<section>
  <div className="my-64 w-full">
    <ZoomParalaxAnimation pictures={pictures} />
  </div>
</section>
```
